**Container Use** lets each of your coding agents have their own containerized environment. Go from babysitting one agent at a time to enabling multiple agents to work safely and independently with your preferred stack. Check out the [Container Use playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyHqb4A5ee1u5LrsbalfVkBRsrbjDsnN5) to see examples of how others are using it.

It's an open-source MCP server that works as a CLI tool with Claude Code, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible agents.

* 📦 **Isolated Environments**: Each agent gets a fresh container in its own git branch - run multiple agents without conflicts, experiment safely, discard failures instantly.
* 👀 **Real-time Visibility**: See complete command history and logs of what agents actually did, not just what they claim.
* 🚁 **Direct Intervention**: Drop into any agent's terminal to see their state and take control when they get stuck.
* 🎮 **Environment Control**: Standard git workflow - just `git checkout <branch_name>` to review any agent's work.
* 🌎 **Universal Compatibility**: Works with any agent, model, or infrastructure - no vendor lock-in.

## Install

### macOS (Homebrew - Recommended)

```sh
brew install dagger/tap/container-use
```

### All Platforms (Shell Script)

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dagger/container-use/main/install.sh | bash
```

This will check for Docker & Git (required), detect your platform, and install the latest `cu` binary to your `$PATH`.

## Building

To build the `cu` binary without installing it to your `$PATH`, you can use either Dagger or Go directly:

### Using Go

```sh
go build -o cu ./cmd/cu
```

### Using Dagger

```sh
dagger call build --platform=current export --path ./cu
```

## Integrate Agents

Enabling `container-use` requires 2 steps:

1. Adding an MCP configuration for `container-use` corresponding to the repository.
2. (Optional) Adding a rule so the agent uses containarized environments.

### [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/tutorials#set-up-model-context-protocol-mcp)

Add the container-use MCP:

```sh
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
cd /path/to/repository
claude mcp add container-use -- <full path to cu command> stdio
```

Save the CLAUDE.md file at the root of the repository. Alternatively, merge the instructions into your own CLAUDE.md.

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dagger/container-use/main/rules/agent.md >> CLAUDE.md
```

To trust only the Container Use environment tools, invoke Claude Code like this:

```sh
claude --allowedTools mcp__container-use__environment_checkpoint,mcp__container-use__environment_file_delete,mcp__container-use__environment_file_list,mcp__container-use__environment_file_read,mcp__container-use__environment_file_write,mcp__container-use__environment_open,mcp__container-use__environment_run_cmd,mcp__container-use__environment_update
```

### [Amazon Q Developer CLI chat](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/command-line-chat.html)

Add this container-use MCP config to `~/.aws/amazonq/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "container-use": {
      "command": "cu",
      "args": [
        "stdio"
      ],
      "env": {},
      "timeout": 60000
    }
  }
}
```

Save the agent instructions for Container Use to your project root at `./.amazonq/rules/container-use.md`:

```sh
mkdir -p ./.amazonq/rules && curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dagger/container-use/main/rules/agent.md > .amazonq/rules/container-use.md
```

To trust only the Container Use environment tools, invoke Q chat like this:

```sh
q chat --trust-tools=container_use___environment_checkpoint,container_use___environment_file_delete,container_use___environment_file_list,container_use___environment_file_read,container_use___environment_file_write,container_use___environment_open,container_use___environment_run_cmd,container_use___environment_update
```

### [Goose](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/getting-started/using-extensions#mcp-servers)


Add this to `~/.config/goose/config.yaml`:

```yaml
extensions:
  container-use:
    name: container-use
    type: stdio
    enabled: true
    cmd: cu
    args:
    - stdio
    envs: {}
```
or use `goose configure` and add a command line extension with `cu stdio` as the command.

For the Goose desktop, paste this into your browser: 
<code>
goose://extension?cmd=cu&arg=stdio&id=container-use&name=container%20use&description=use%20containers%20with%20dagger%20and%20git%20for%20isolated%20environments"
</code>


### [Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol)

First, install the MCP server by using the deeplink below (this assumes you have Cursor and Container-use already installed):

[![Install MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-light.svg)](https://cursor.com/install-mcp?name=container-use&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoiY3Ugc3RkaW8ifQ%3D%3D)

Then, add the following rule, either at the root of your project or in your home directory (global).

```sh
curl --create-dirs -o .cursor/rules/container-use.mdc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dagger/container-use/main/rules/cursor.mdc
```

### [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers) / [GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/extending-copilot-chat-with-mcp)

[Watch video walkthrough.](https://youtu.be/Nz2sOef0gW0)

The result of the instructions above will be to update your VSCode settings with something that looks like this:

```json
    "mcp": {
        "servers": {
            "container-use": {
                "type": "stdio",
                "command": "cu",
                "args": [
                    "stdio"
                ]
            }
        }
    }
```

Once the MCP server is running, you can optionally update the instructions for copilot using the following:

```sh
curl --create-dirs -o .github/copilot-instructions.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dagger/container-use/main/rules/agent.md
```

### [Cline](https://cline.bot/)

Add the following to your Cline MCP server configuration JSON:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "container-use": {
      "disabled": false,
      "timeout": 60000,
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "cu",
      "args": [
        "stdio"
      ],
      "env": {},
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

### [Qodo Gen](https://docs.qodo.ai/qodo-documentation/qodo-gen/qodo-gen-chat/agentic-mode/agentic-tools-mcps)

1. Open Qodo Gen chat panel in VSCode or IntelliJ.
2. Click Connect more tools.
3. Click + Add new MCP.
4. Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
      "container-use": {
          "command": "cu",
          "args": [
              "stdio"
          ]
      }
  }
}
```

Include the container-use prompt in your Cline rules:

```sh
curl --create-dirs -o .clinerules/container-use.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dagger/container-use/main/rules/agent.md
```

### [Kilo Code](https://kilocode.ai/docs/features/mcp/using-mcp-in-kilo-code)

`Kilo Code` allows setting MCP servers at the global or project level.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "container-use": {
      "command": "replace with pathname of cu",
      "args": [
        "stdio"
      ],
      "env": {},
      "alwaysAllow": [],
      "disabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

### [OpenAI Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex)

`Codex` allows setting MCP servers with the new experimental Rust version available [here](https://github.com/openai/codex/tree/main/codex-rs).

In your `~/.codex/config.toml`, add the following:

```toml
[mcp_servers.container-use]
command = "cu"
args = ["stdio"]
env = {}
```

## Examples

| Example | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [hello_world.md](examples/hello_world.md) | Creates a simple app and runs it, accessible via localhost HTTP URL |
| [parallel.md](examples/parallel.md) | Creates and serves two variations of a hello world app (Flask and FastAPI) on different URLs |
| [security.md](examples/security.md) | Security scanning example that checks for updates/vulnerabilities in the repository, applies updates, verifies builds still work, and generates patch file |

### Run with [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code)

```console
cat ./examples/hello_world.md | claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

_If you see a "Raw mode is not supported" error then run `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` directly, accept the terms and try the above command again._

### Run with [Goose](https://block.github.io/goose/)

```console
goose run -i ./examples/hello_world.md -s
```

### Run with [Kilo Code](https://kilocode.ai/) in `vscode`

Prompt as in `parallel.md` but add a sentence 'use container-use mcp'

## Watch your agents work

Your agents will automatically commit to a container-use remote on your local filesystem. You can watch the progress of your agents in real time by running:

```console
cu watch
```

## How it Works

container-use is an Model Context Protocol server that provides Environments to an agent. Environments are an abstraction over containers and git branches powered by dagger and git worktrees. For more information, see [environment/README.md](environment/README.md).
