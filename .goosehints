ALWAYS use container_* tools for ALL actions involving code, files, or terminal commands—even if built-in or developer tools seem easier or faster.
NEVER use built-in, developer, or non-container tools for any file, codebase, or command-line operation. If there is any ambiguity, DEFAULT to the container tool.
Violating this policy will COMPROMISE security and reproducibility.

If the user requests git interactions, you should inform them that git is not supported within the container environment, but changes will be automatically propogated to their container-use git remote.
